rcmd.py
=======

Python script to run a list of commands on remote network devices.

Tested on Cisco IOS, NX-OS, Arista EOS and Juniper JunOS devices.

Usage:
        rcmd.py -c cmdfile -i cfgfile [options] host

        -c cmdfile      Commands file
        -i cfgfile      Config file
        host            Hostname of device to connect to (MUST exist in device DB)

        Options:
        -d              Dump all in/output from beginning
        -l logfile      Define a logfile to send output to
        -t timeout      Define timeout for commands (default 45 seconds)


Command file - text file containing list of commands to run. e.g.

    show clock
    show version
    show ip int brief | e unas


Config file - Config file containing credentials, SOCKS proxy configs and location of device DB. e.g.

    [Auth1]
    username=<USER1>
    password=<PASSWORD1>

    [Auth2]
    username=<USER2>
    password=<PASSWORD2>

    [Auth3]
    username=<USER3>
    password=<PASSWORD3>

    [Auth4]
    include_auth=Auth1
    enable_password=<PASSWORD4>

    [Proxy1]
    server=127.0.0.1
    port=4001
    sshconfig=<PATH_TO_SSH_PROXY_CONFIG>

    [Proxy2]
    server=127.0.0.1
    port=4002
    sshconfig=<PATH_TO_SSH_PROXY_CONFIG>

    [DevicesDB]
    path=<PATH_TO_DEVICES_DB>


<SSH_PROXY_CONFIG> - ssh config file with ProxyCommand. e.g.

    StrictHostKeyChecking no
    ProxyCommand /usr/bin/nc -x 127.0.0.1:4001 %h %p


<DEVICE_DB> - Sqlite3 DB with devices information. Table created using following SQL command :-

    CREATE TABLE Devices ( 
        Hostname   TEXT PRIMARY KEY ASC
                        NOT NULL
                        UNIQUE,
        MgmtIP     TEXT NOT NULL
                        UNIQUE,
        DeviceType TEXT NOT NULL,
        ConnMethod TEXT NOT NULL,
        ProxyID    INT  NOT NULL,
        AuthID     INT 
    );

    Hostname - Unique hostname of device
    MgmtIP - Unique IP address of device
    DeviceType - C - Cisco, A - Arista, J - Juniper, F - Cisco Firewall
    ConnMethod - S - SSH, T - Telnet
    ProxyID - number to indicate which [Proxy#] section to use in config file. 0 for no proxy.
    AuthID - number to indicate which [Auth#] section to use in config file.


===============================

BUG #001 : Sometimes buffer at the end (just before exit command) is not shown/logged.
Seen mostly with Cisco ASA FW (getting SSH broken pipe after exit command???).
FIXED: Send extra CR-LF before exit to flush buffer.

BUG #002 : Router prompt matching "Device#" in "show version" on Cisco 2900/3900 series routers.
Need to adjust router prompt to exclude this somehow.

BUG #003 : Prompt not working for Arista devices.
FIXED: Set TERM to vt100 to disable escape characters being sent by Arista devices attempting to change xterm title.
