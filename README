BUG #001 : Sometimes buffer at the end (just before exit command) is not shown/logged.
Seen mostly with Cisco ASA FW (getting SSH broken pipe after exit command???).
FIXED: Send extra CR-LF before exit to flush buffer.

BUG #002 : Router prompt matching "Device#" in "show version" on Cisco 2900/3900 series routers.
Need to adjust router prompt to exclude this somehow.

BUG #003 : Prompt not working for Arista devices.
FIXED: Set TERM to vt100 to disable escape characters being sent by Arista devices attempting to change xterm title.
